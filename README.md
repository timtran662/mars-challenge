# Getting Started with the Mars Challenge Project

This project was created using React/Typescript. 

To run, please cd into the mars-challenge directory and run: 

- npm start 

Following that, import/replace the input file named "input.txt" under this directory: 
- mars-challenge/public

Finally, after the file has been loaded. Click on the "Run their instructions" button and the output will be calculated. 

In green are rovers with valid instructions. 

In red are the rovers whose input are invalid but still calculated.
